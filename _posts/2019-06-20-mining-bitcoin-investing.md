<p>At some point, you will start making good money from bitcoin mining. Hopefully, that point has come already. But ultimately, what matters is what you do with that money. Chances are you're not mining as a full-time thing. You do it in your spare time for some extra cash. Well, that extra cash can become a goldmine.
<p>You may not have any experience investing in any market, but these days you no longer need it to get off to a strong start. This <a href="https://investorjunkie.com/">investing blog</a> has all the information a beginner investor needs to get going, as well as plenty of more advanced articles. Everything can be learned online now.
<p>Furthermore, you don’t need all that much time to invest, either. These days, artificial intelligence is at the core of the most useful investment tools.
<p>These are the sort of tools that can turn anyone into an investor.
<p><h2>Robo Advisors</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, tons of robo advisors have popped up online. These are exactly what they sound like – and more. A robo advisor is constructed from algorithms that parse all the information available to come up with the trades and investments most likely to pay dividends.
<p>Now, trades and investments today might not act like they did yesterday, and that might discourage you from trusting a robo advisor. However, they don’t only use the information available and the algorithms preprogrammed. They use <a href="https://www.expertsystem.com/machine-learning-definition/">advanced machine learning</a> to adapt way quicker than a human ever could.
<p>A robo advisor does more than just advise. It will actually do the work for you, making trades according to basic principles you determine at the start. If you ever want to step in, you can, applying that human touch that is sometimes necessary.
<p>The best robo advisors are in fact hybrids. For example, some companies offer expert financial advice from human advisors when you feel you need it.

<p><h2>Increase Your Investment Capital</h2>
<p>When investing, you should always be responsible and only use money you won’t miss. This is why money that you have made on the side while mining bitcoin is ideal. But there are ways to add to this investment capital without having to do extra work.
<p>By budgeting, you are likely to end up saving money simply by cutting out costs that <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/25-unnecessary-wastes-money-you-dont-think-about.html">you didn’t realize were making such a difference</a>. However, budgeting takes time. Great budgeting apps such as Mint, are therefore perfect tools for those of us who work full time.
<p>Budgeting apps connect directly to your bank accounts and categorize everything for you, showing you exactly where you have spent your money. You just need to assess the neat charts and graphs provided to see how much you've been wasting.
<p>Furthermore, there are apps like Acorn which use the concept of “spare change” to help you save. They round up every transaction you make to the nearest dollar, and put that money into a separate savings account. This small change is something you won’t miss, which means it’s perfect to add to your investment capital.
<p>Investing is no longer for those who have the experience and time. Anyone can do it, and if you're already making extra cash, you might as well give it a try.
