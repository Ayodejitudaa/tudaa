<p>The need for a VPN has shot up over the past few years. As we get closer and closer to living our entire lives online, our data becomes ever more vulnerable. We put everything out there when using the internet, from our credit card details to our personal identification.
<p>It’s no wonder that identity theft has become a common occurrence.
<p>Identity theft can be devastating. Not only do victims of identity theft lose masses of money. They also compromise their entire reputation. Getting credit or even a job in future becomes problematic because of misdeeds committed under their name.
<p>However, many people engaged in bitcoin mining aren’t convinced of the need for a VPN. Blockchain is indeed very secure and seems to offer the protection of encryption on its own.
<p>But bitcoin miners actually do need VPNs for a number of reasons. It would be wise to get the top ranked paid VPN subscription that would provide you with additional layer of security.
<p>If you're not convinced yet, you can get one of the <a href="https://www.bestonlinereviews.com/vpn/completely-free-vpns/">real free VPN</a> services and try it without commitment. When you get a better idea, you would be able to choose wisely.
<p><h2>Never enough security</h2>
<p>The thing about cryptocurrency is that its very nature requires a certain amount of risk-taking. Everything can come tumbling down with some irresponsible practices, and a currency can be brought to its knees.
<p>Now, you're not going to destroy bitcoin, and the idea that you might is almost akin to suggesting you could accidentally delete the internet. However, just as the currency itself takes every single precaution, so should you.
<p>You are making a living online, and therefore every layer of security helps.
<p>Furthermore, just because the currency is secure, doesn't mean you are. While you are mining for bitcoin, your bitcoin might be safe but your identity is not. You live your life online, including your entire financial life.
<p>It is only prudent that you protect that.
<p><h2>Anywhere in the world</h2>
<p>Another reason you need a VPN is that one of the major advantages of making money from bitcoin mining is that you can do it from anywhere.
<p>Travel the world if you like without ever compromising your ability to make money.
<p>Unfortunately, not every country is open to the idea of bitcoin. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2132119/beijing-bans-bitcoin-when-did-it-all-go-wrong-cryptocurrencies">Restrictive places like China</a>, among others, have banned bitcoin, and you are unable to mine when you're there.
<p>But if you are using a VPN, you don’t need to worry about these bans. You can simply set your server to any other country in the world and mine without a problem. Just be sure that you take other precautions, such as not doing so in a public space.
<p>Speaking of which...
<p><h2>Public WiFi is Dangerous</h2>
<p>Even if you're in the US or another open country, you may be in danger when mining in public. This is not because of bans or the like, but because <a href="https://www.inc.com/comcast/risks-of-using-public-wifi.html">public WiFi is incredibly dangerous</a>.
<p>As long as you're using a public WiFi network, your data is under threat.
<p>Never use public WiFi without first connecting to a VPN, no matter what you're using it for. When you're doing something as financially significant as bitcoin mining, it is all the more necessary.
